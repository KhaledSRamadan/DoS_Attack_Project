# DoS_Attack_Project
In this project we tried to be simple and straightforward, we found an amazing python library called scapy which allows us to parse the packets coming to the machine through the network and with the help of terminal commands block the IPs of machines that try to flood ours.
The code only needs python3 and scapy to be installed on the linux machine, which can be done by the following commands:

sudo apt install python3
pip install --pre scapy[complete]

Then finally run the program by python3:
python3 detector.py
